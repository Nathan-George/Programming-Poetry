# Week 13 IJ Practice: Creative Expression with Blended Media

This is an experiment in combining the syntax of a programming language with that of a narrative and story. In order to force an interesting dynamic in how a story can be told through a program, I have required that at a minimum the program to compile and the primary narrative elements to be told through code rather than through strings and comments. Hopefully, this creates a unique dynamic in how stories are told within the code I write.

## Source Idea

I was talking with some friends about whether or not a programming language is a language. Certainly this depends on your definition of language, but I think that we came to the conclusion that it is not. A programming language in it's compiled, exactable form is an expression of procedure of what to do, and maybe how to do it. Thus, programs are very analogous to thinks like cook books which are a subset of language. However, I believe that one cannot express every idea in a real language as just cook books, which means that programming languages must only be a subset of real languages and not actually language.

## Explanation

The narrative that I am trying to express through the program is the joy of questions in how they lead to thinking and sometimes into a state of awe over the world that we get to experience. What's more, this process repeats, spurred on by wonder generating new questions and new explorations.

## How to run

In the terminal execute
```
g++ -o main main.cpp
./main
```
